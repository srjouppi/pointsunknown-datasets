The migrant was traveling with at least nine other migrants - when they encountered two border patrol agents, the migrants fled. When chasing a migrant, one of the agents said the man turned and threw a punch at him, after which a struggle ensued. The agent claimed that he feared for his life, asserting that the migrant picked up a large rock during the struggle, and that he then opened fire and killed the migrant in self-defense. No one else witnessed the shooting. Other migrants traveling with the man who was killed claimed that agents appeared to move his body and tamper with evidence. They also claimed that the agent's partner advised him to say that he feared for his life and to claim that the slain man had picked up a rock, which a subsequent investigation described as a possible indication that agents attempted to cover up evidence. Multiple migrants also claimed that a border patrol agent said 'this is America motherfucker' while apprehending them - some of these migrants claimed that the border patrol agent who killed the migrant they were traveling with was the agent who said this. On 9 May 2022, the Cochise County Attorney's Office announced that it had insufficient evidence to bring charges against the border patrol agent because his description of events appeared justified under Arizona self-defense laws, though it did confirm that the Border Patrol crime scene response unit, the Critical Incident Teams, was involved in the case.
